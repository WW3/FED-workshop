<h1>Click event &amp; semantics</h1>
<p>
  The bellow "custom button" is made out of a span element with a tabindex set to "0" to make it focusable and a "button" role to inform SR users this is a suppoed button.
  <br>
  The button default styles are reset and new custom  styles are applied to both elements to reflect mouse users perceived (same) experience. 
  <br>
  This page attaches a "click" listener to both elements (button, span). When these elements are clicked, a background color style is toggled on the body element.
</p>
<p>This page demonstrates that a click event handler on a button element automatically fires a keydown and a keyup events, while the same click listener on the none interactive span element doesn't fire these keyboard events.</p>
